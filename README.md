# Reinforcement-Learning-With-Gym
Simple and efficient [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) deep reinforcement algorithm implementation tested by [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/). Easy for starters ü•≥.
## Step 1 : Setup up environment
To install Gym, you can follow this [instruction](https://github.com/openai/gym#installing-everything).  
Since some environments like `LunarLanderContinuous-V2` need fully installationÔºåyou may need to additionally do this:
```
pip install 'gym[box2d]'
```
## Step 2 : Train your agent or test trained agent ü§ñ
1. By run `LunarLanderContinuous-V2_train.py` you can train a lunar landing robot by using [SAC](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01290) algorithm.
2. By run `LunarLanderContinuous-V2_test.py` you can see the performance of my trained robot after about 180 episodes.

## Step 3 : Explore the detail of the algorithm and do your own jobüëè
This implementation is well arranged and easy to understand. Enjoy your learning of Deep Reinforcement Algorithm.
